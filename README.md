# Analysis-and-Design-of-Deep-Neural-Networks
In this repository, the projetcs of the Analysis and Design of Deep Neural-Networks course are presented. The titles of these projects are as fallows:
1. Deep Metric Learning over LFW Dataset
   - Euclidean Distance Metric
   - Cosine Similarity Distance Metric
   - Example Mining Metric Loss
2. SI Metric Analysis of VGG11 Network
   - Train Whole Network and Apply SI Metric over Convolutional Layer
   - Train Network Layervise with Freezing Layers and Apply SI Metric over Convolutional Layers
   - Train Network Layervise without Freezing Layers and Apply SI Metric over Convolutional Layers
